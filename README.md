# FoodLink

We try to create a mobile app which can connect food and people.

Two key pains we try to solve:

1. We don't wanna eat alone any more.

2. We want friends. And dining together seems like a good excuse to reach out with strangers.

For front end, we use [jTinder](https://github.com/do-web/jTinder), bootstrap and w3.css.

For back end, we use AWS and flask.
